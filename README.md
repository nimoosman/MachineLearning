### Overview:
Using various data sources to compare number of tweets to the effect of the local economy, specifically tourism. 
#### Methods:
Used Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas, SciKit and Linear Regression to plot, display, and predict the data.
#### Data Sources:
Twitter Scraper from Taspinar Github - https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper
Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department - http://www.censtatd.gov.hk/hkstat
Hong Kong Tourism Board and Immigration Department - https://partnernet.hktb.com/en/research

### Findings: 
Figures show that there is a direct correlation between the number of tweets about #FreeHongKong, #HongKongProtest, #加油香港 and the local economy such as tourism.

#### Sentiment Analysis:
We used sentiment analysis to determine overall support for the protest, whether postive, negative, or neutral.  But due to natural language, it was determined that we were not able to depend on this data as certain negative sentiments proved to be in support of the protests and vice versa.

#### Linear Regression: 
Although this data does tell a narrative, our team took an objective approach at the current situation – neither for or against the protestors.

Limitations:  We found some limitations in that there is a darth of data on the effects of the protests.   Our datasets were small dataset 100,000 limit which scraped 40,000 points of data only from Twitter. Additionally, data generated and events are ongoing. Finally, our research and process was conducted in English, not Chinese. 

#### Future Research: 
One of our team members was recently in Hong Kong, where college students and colleagues have reached out about the need to track and document what is happening in terms of Big Data. First account data, such as numbers of protestors, foodstuffs donated, man-hours contributed, and incidence of solidarity are hardly recorded. It is through these firsthand accounts that we can draw richer narratives.
